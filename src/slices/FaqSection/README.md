# FAQ Section

### Purpose of the component

Component with repeatable dropdown section for creating FAQ sections.
The accordion uses progressive enhancement as an approach to build the interactivity of the component.
This means that the accordion starts out as a non-interactive component, and then interactivity and appropriate styles are added to it when the JavaScript runs.

### Variations

1. Default
   This default version on the component use the simple dropdowns to be used where and as you require.
2. Faq
   This version is a more complete website section, including a title and description to create a a basic FAQ page.
3. With Image
   Much like the full section but using the optional image for more destinct styling.
